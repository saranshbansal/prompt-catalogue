Welcome, mortal. You've stumbled into my Prompt Catalogue — a gloriously chaotic, meticulously organized, and borderline supernatural library of prompts designed to bend language models to your will. This README is intentionally dramatic. Proceed only if you accept occasional hyperbole and machine-assisted brilliance.

## TL;DR (Because You're Probably in a Hurry)
- Collection of unique prompts, templates, and vibes for different tasks.
- Copy. Paste. Tweak. Dominate.

## Why this exists

There are two types of people in the world:
1. Those who write prompts like they're sending a formal memo.
2. Those who treat prompts like ritual incantations.

This repository is for #2. It houses prompts that are crafted, optimized, annotated, and labeled with emotional intensity. Use them to prototype, ship, and meme your way to better outputs.

## What you'll find here
- Curated prompts organized by intent and power level.
- Templates for common workflows (summaries, refactors, role-playing interviews, data extraction).
- "Variants" that show escalation from polite to savage.
- Recommended model settings and expected output shapes.
- Small analytics: what worked, what flopped, and why.
